# AI / Machine Learning Internship Portfolio

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **industry-oriented AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision projects** developed during an intensive internship program.

All projects are implemented end-to-end with a strong focus on:
- clean code
- real-world problem solving
- proper documentation
- reproducible experiments

Most models were developed and trained using **Google Colab** for efficient experimentation and GPU support.

## 📌 Note for Recruiters

These projects were developed as part of an **industry-oriented internship**, focusing on real-world scenarios, clean implementation, and practical understanding rather than toy examples.

Each project can be clearly explained during interviews, including:
- problem motivation
- model selection
- evaluation metrics
- real-world applicability
